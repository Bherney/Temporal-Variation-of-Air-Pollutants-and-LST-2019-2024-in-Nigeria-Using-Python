# Temporal Variation of Air Pollutants and Land Surface Temperature (2019â€“2024)

This repository presents an analysis of the **seasonal and temporal variations of air pollutants**  
(NOâ‚‚, CO, SOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ) and **Land Surface Temperature (LST)** across Nigeria from **January 2019 to December 2024**.  

The study highlights seasonal cycles, pollutant intensity levels, and the interactions between surface warming and ozone formation.

### Key Findings
Nitrogen Dioxide (NOâ‚‚)
- Exhibited a distinct seasonal cycle.
- High intensity typically occurred in dry season months (Novemberâ€“March).

Sulfur Dioxide (SOâ‚‚)
- Concentrations remained relatively constant over the study period.
- No clear seasonal variation observed.
- Occasional spikes likely caused by localized emissions or industrial events.

Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Showed a clear and consistent seasonal cycle.
- High concentrations during the dry season.
- Low concentrations during the wet season due to enhanced atmospheric dispersion.

Ozone (Oâ‚ƒ)
- Seasonal maxima occurred between Marchâ€“May.
- Seasonal minima occurred between Septemberâ€“November.
- Trends suggest a photochemical link between surface warming and ozone generation.

Land Surface Temperature (LST)
- Showed consistent seasonal variation.
- Peaks in the transitional months (Marchâ€“April).
- Troughs around the peak wet season (Julyâ€“August).
- Seasonal LST patterns appeared synchronized with Oâ‚ƒ, supporting a photochemical connection.
