# Statistical Comparison of Forecasting Models for Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Nigeria

The study assesses their predictive performance in forecasting **Land Surface Temperature (LST) across Nigerian states** using RMSE values.This repository contains data, scripts, and plots for the **statistical evaluation of three forecasting models**:

- **Curve Fit Forecast**
- **Exponential Smoothing Forecast**
- **Forest-Based Forecast**

# Statistical Analysis

To evaluate whether the models differed significantly in predictive performance:

### Friedman Test
- **Chi-Square statistic**: 47.19  
- **p-value**: < 0.0001  

Strong rejection of the null hypothesis â†’ Not all models performed equally.

### Nemenyi Post-Hoc Test

| Model Comparison | p-value   | Significance |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Curve Fit vs. Exponential Smoothing | 0.00000 | Significant |
| Curve Fit vs. Forest-Based Forecast | 0.00000 | Significant |
| Exponential Smoothing vs. Forest-Based Forecast | 0.18901 | Not significant |

## Key Findings

- **Curve Fit** performed **significantly worse** than both Exponential Smoothing and Forest-Based Forecast.  
- **Exponential Smoothing** and **Forest-Based Forecast** showed **comparable performance** (no significant difference).  
- Ensemble/advanced approaches (**Exponential Smoothing & Forest-Based**) are **more reliable for LST prediction** than Curve Fit.

## Critical Distance (CD) Diagram

To visualize the average ranks and statistical significance, a **Critical Distance diagram** was generated using the Nemenyi test.  
- The diagram shows that **Exponential Smoothing** and **Forest-Based Forecast** are statistically similar, while **Curve Fit** stands apart with worse performance.
